# Purely functional data structures in Lean 4

Playing around with (some of) the data structures described in Chris Okasaki's book *"Purely
functional data structures"* and Lean 4.

Okasaki writes programs in SML which is not dependently-typed and does not have ITP features. I
tried to write the strongest / safest version of the examples and exercises when possible and
relevant, though my lean-fu is still quite limited.
